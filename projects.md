### **Systems biology approach of understanding azole resistance mechanisms in *Candida albicans***

Candida albicans is a commensal fungus pathogen commonly reported to cause candidiasis in immunocompromised patients. Noteworthy, it is reported as the most common fungal infection in the critical care setting. The current antifungal agent of choice is fluconazole, which is classified under the azole antifungals. It acts by inhibiting the ergosterol biosynthesis pathway, which is an essential component of the fungal cell membrane. However, in recent years, there has been a significant increase in fluconazole-resistant C. albicans as this has already been classified as a serious threat by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Hence, there is a need to investigate the azole resistance mechanisms of C. albicans and to find possible drug targets. 

We aim to investigate the azole resistance mechanisms in Candida albicans using systems approach (mathematical and computational modeling) to identify important biomarkers for possible drug targets. The models aim to aid researchers narrow down the possible drug targets prior to doing costly and time-consuming experiments, and to serve as a cross-validation tool for experimental data.
