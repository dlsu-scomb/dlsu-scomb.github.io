### **Metagenomic and genomic surveillance of antimicrobial resistance in hospital wastewater and computational prediction of efficacy of alternative non-antibiotic therapeutics (ATTACK-AMR)**

The cooperative research project ATTACK-AMR involves teams from the US, Japan, Australia, Thailand, and the Philippines; and it aims to deliver alternative, non-antibiotic therapies to combat antimicrobial resistant (AMR) pathogens. AMR is one of the biggest challenges facing healthcare industries and is on a rapid rise as a result of the overuse of antibiotics. Replacing antibiotics with alternative products will delay the resistance and restore the activity of antibiotics that are no longer effective due to resistance.

In collaboration with our e-Asia JRP partners, the project aims to attack the problem of AMR in the Philippines on three fronts using next-generation sequencing technology and advanced machine-learning/AI tools. First, we will perform a resistome analysis of hospital waste-water metagenomes collected from 3 hospitals in Metro Manila. Similar metagenomic data will also be collected in partner countries. Bioinformatics analysis of the metagenomic data will provide insights into the abundance and diversity of AMR genes in our hospital wastewater and serve as a baseline measure for any future intervention studies.  Next, we will collect, sequence, and analyze clinical isolates of *P. aeruginosa* and *A. baumannii* using available genome data. These isolates will be used and will be subjected to drug efflux pump inhibitors molecules identified by the Australian team. Finally, we will build system biology and machine-learning/AI models that can in-silico predict the efficacy of alternative therapies such as phage therapy and ecobiotics based on experimental data produced by the Thailand and US teams.

**Systems biology approach of understanding azole resistance mechanisms in *Candida albicans***

Candida albicans is a commensal fungus pathogen commonly reported to cause candidiasis in immunocompromised patients. Noteworthy, it is reported as the most common fungal infection in the critical care setting. The current antifungal agent of choice is fluconazole, which is classified under the azole antifungals. It acts by inhibiting the ergosterol biosynthesis pathway, which is an essential component of the fungal cell membrane. However, in recent years, there has been a significant increase in fluconazole-resistant C. albicans as this has already been classified as a serious threat by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Hence, there is a need to investigate the azole resistance mechanisms of C. albicans and to find possible drug targets. 

We aim to investigate the azole resistance mechanisms in Candida albicans using systems approach (mathematical and computational modeling) to identify important biomarkers for possible drug targets. The models aim to aid researchers narrow down the possible drug targets prior to doing costly and time-consuming experiments, and to serve as a cross-validation tool for experimental data.
