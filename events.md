### [2022/06/28] [LNest Grant Global Challenge Award 2022](https://grant.lne.st/research/global-challenge-award/)

Congratulations to Mr. Paul K. Yu, a research assistant at the Systems & Computational Biology (SComB) research unit of the College of Science Center for Natural Sciences and Environmental Research (CENSER) and an MS graduate fellow of the Department of Science and Technology-Science Education Institute (DOST-SEI), for being selected as one of the awardees of the LNest Grant Global Challenge Award 2022. The project title is “Systems biology approach of understanding azole resistance mechanisms in *Candida albicans*.” The research is in collaboration with Dr. Llewelyn S. Moron-Espiritu from the Department of Biology of De La Salle University and a member of the SComB research unit, and Prof. Angelyn R. Lao from the Department of Mathematics and Statistics of De La Salle University, and the head of the SComB research unit.

Project summary:

Candidiasis is reported as the most common fungal infection in the critical care setting. Its causative agent is an opportunistic fungus belonging to the genus *Candida*, the most common species of which is the *Candida albicans*. The current antifungal drug of choice for the treatment of Candidiasis is fluconazole, which is classified under azole antifungals, primarily due to its low cost, limited toxicity, and bioavailability. Its mechanism of action is the inhibition of the C14α-demethylase enzyme, a key enzyme in the ergosterol pathway, thereby blocking the synthesis of ergosterol, which is an integral component of the fungal cell membrane. In recent years, the significant increase of fluconazole-resistant *C. albicans* in clinical samples calls for a need to search for other possible drug targets. In this study, we constructed a mathematical model of the ergosterol pathway of *C. albicans* using ordinary differential equations with mass-action kinetics. Using the model, we plan to conduct various simulations to understand fluconazole resistance mechanisms in the ergosterol pathway and look for possible drug targets. The models aim to aid researchers to narrow down the possible drug targets prior to doing costly and time-consuming experiments, and to serve as a cross-validation tool for experimental data.

### [2022/06/20-2022/07/11] DLSU-PSHS Summer Internship Program: Mathematical Modeling

The SComB research unit took part in the 2022 DLSU-PSHS Summer Internship Program. We conducted lecture-based and hands-on workshop on Mathematical Modeling. Three senior high school students from the Philippine Science High School were accepted as our interns. On week 1, lectures were given on introduction mathematical modeling and its workflow, with hands-on workshop on the Python programming language, Wolfram Mathematica software, and LaTeX typesetting using Overleaf. On week 2, the lecture was on scientific communication and the interns were given a problem set on forecasting fuel prices, to be worked as a group. This is to prepare for their final project, to be presented at the last day of the internship program. The interns attended an actual thesis proposal defense by an MS Mathematics student. On week 3, the interns were exposed to various researches at the 2022 DLSU Research Congress. The full details are shown in the <a href='/assets/pshs_2022_syllabus.pdf'>Course Syllabus<a/>.
