### [2024/03/13] JP Defends His MS Mathematics Thesis

Congratulations to Mr. John Paul Guzman for successfully defending his MS Mathematics thesis entitled "Aspect-Based Sentiment Analysis of Filipino COVID-19 Tweets with Memory Networks."

<img src='/assets/2024-03-13-jp-defense.png' width='800' />

ABSTRACT

Sentiment analysis is the process of extracting opinions from text. It has a wide variety of applications, such as monitoring social media, processing customer reviews, and improving health communication. Aspect-based sentiment classification (ABSC) is a type of sentiment analysis that determines sentiments toward specified aspects in a given text. Knowledge about the specific target of the opinion allows for a more fine-grained analysis of sentiments. This results in richer insights that can lead to further applications.

In this paper, the goal is to model the ABSC task to be applicable to texts in various languages and topics. To achieve this, we study the mathematical foundations of machine learning and deep learning. We explore techniques to overcome the challenges associated with multilingual ABSC, such as working with limited data, varying grammar structures, and out-of-vocabulary words. Then, we construct a memory network as a mathematical model for the task of multilingual ABSC. Our model is evaluated on four datasets to demonstrate its capacity to learn the grammatical rules pertinent to ABSC across various languages and topics. Three benchmark datasets in English are used to compare our model with existing ones. Additionally, we created a multilingual dataset referred to as the FHT dataset. This dataset consists of health-related tweets published in the Philippines during the COVID-19 pandemic. The tweets are written in English and Filipino, with possible code-switching. Our model achieved slight improvements over similar models in the benchmark datasets. Meanwhile, its performance in the FHT dataset is comparable to that observed in the benchmark datasets. Finally, we demonstrated potential applications that utilize insights from an ABSC model. This includes using ABSC to analyze the sentiments gathered during the COVID-19 pandemic.

SComB members attended the eAsia-AMR meeting at Keio University Mita Campus, Tokyo organized by the Japan team. Teams from Thailand, Australia, and the Philippines were physically present while the US team and some members  who were not able to attend in person attended the meeting virtually. Our Year 2 eAsia research on exploring alternative non-antibiotic treatments to tackle AMR (ATTACK-AMR) has made significant strides, particularly the broadening of our collaboration. This year, we extend a warm welcome to the [EnD-AMR-Asia consortium](https://env.w3.kanazawa-u.ac.jp/end-amr-asia/), facilitated by Prof. Ryo Honda, to contribute their perspectives and efforts towards local and global AMR surveillance. 

During the morning session, all teams presented their progress updates followed by the introduction of the EnD-AMR-Asia consortium. In the afternoon session, Dr. Haruo Suzuki held a workshop on Introduction to R and phylogenetic analysis. After the workshop, the team had a gathering at a nearby izakaya.

### [2022/06/28] [LNest Grant Global Challenge Award 2022](https://grant.lne.st/research/global-challenge-award/)

Congratulations to Mr. Paul K. Yu, a research assistant at the Systems & Computational Biology (SComB) research unit of the College of Science Center for Natural Sciences and Environmental Research (CENSER) and an MS graduate fellow of the Department of Science and Technology-Science Education Institute (DOST-SEI), for being selected as one of the awardees of the LNest Grant Global Challenge Award 2022. The project title is “Systems biology approach of understanding azole resistance mechanisms in *Candida albicans*.” The research is in collaboration with Dr. Llewelyn S. Moron-Espiritu from the Department of Biology of De La Salle University and a member of the SComB research unit, and Prof. Angelyn R. Lao from the Department of Mathematics and Statistics of De La Salle University, and the head of the SComB research unit.

Project summary:

Candidiasis is reported as the most common fungal infection in the critical care setting. Its causative agent is an opportunistic fungus belonging to the genus *Candida*, the most common species of which is the *Candida albicans*. The current antifungal drug of choice for the treatment of Candidiasis is fluconazole, which is classified under azole antifungals, primarily due to its low cost, limited toxicity, and bioavailability. Its mechanism of action is the inhibition of the C14α-demethylase enzyme, a key enzyme in the ergosterol pathway, thereby blocking the synthesis of ergosterol, which is an integral component of the fungal cell membrane. In recent years, the significant increase of fluconazole-resistant *C. albicans* in clinical samples calls for a need to search for other possible drug targets. In this study, we constructed a mathematical model of the ergosterol pathway of *C. albicans* using ordinary differential equations with mass-action kinetics. Using the model, we plan to conduct various simulations to understand fluconazole resistance mechanisms in the ergosterol pathway and look for possible drug targets. The models aim to aid researchers to narrow down the possible drug targets prior to doing costly and time-consuming experiments, and to serve as a cross-validation tool for experimental data.

### [2022/06/20-2022/07/11] DLSU-PSHS Summer Internship Program: Mathematical Modeling

The SComB research unit took part in the 2022 DLSU-PSHS Summer Internship Program. We conducted lecture-based and hands-on workshop on Mathematical Modeling. Three senior high school students from the Philippine Science High School were accepted as our interns. On week 1, lectures were given on introduction mathematical modeling and its workflow, with hands-on workshop on the Python programming language, Wolfram Mathematica software, and LaTeX typesetting using Overleaf. On week 2, the lecture was on scientific communication and the interns were given a problem set on forecasting fuel prices, to be worked as a group. This is to prepare for their final project, to be presented at the last day of the internship program. The interns attended an actual thesis proposal defense by an MS Mathematics student. On week 3, the interns were exposed to various researches at the 2022 DLSU Research Congress. The full details are shown in the <a href='/assets/pshs_2022_syllabus.pdf'>Course Syllabus<a/> <br>.
