### [2022/06/20 - 2022/07/11] DLSU-PSHS Summer Internship Program: Mathematical Modeling

The SComB research unit took part in the 2022 DLSU-PSHS Summer Internship Program. We conducted lecture-based and hands-on workshop on Mathematical Modeling. Three senior high school students from the Philippine Science High School were accepted as our interns. On week 1, lectures were given on introduction mathematical modeling and its workflow, with hands-on workshop on the Python programming language, Wolfram Mathematica software, and LaTeX typesetting using Overleaf. On week 2, the lecture was on scientific communication and the interns were given a problem set on forecasting fuel prices, to be worked as a group. This is to prepare for their final project, to be presented at the last day of the internship program. The interns attended an actual thesis proposal defense by an MS Mathematics student. On week 3, the interns were exposed to various researches at the 2022 DLSU Research Congress. The full details are shown in the <a href='/assets/pshs_2022_syllabus.pdf'>Course Syllabus<a/>.
