[SComB](https://dlsu-scomb.github.io/) is a research unit of the [Center for Natural Sciences and Environmental Research](https://www.dlsu.edu.ph/research/research-centers/censer/?fbclid=IwAR2_ZT71u1OxhE9xfvIapV30DncFlfFUkhDu-uuX2Et4S7VO6peHvcDnyU8), dedicated to advancing the understanding of complex biological, medical, and agricultural systems. This unit integrates computational, mathematical, and statistical modeling approaches to provide deeper insights into these intricate systems. By leveraging these interdisciplinary techniques, SComB aims to uncover the fundamental principles that govern the behavior and interactions within various natural and engineered environments.

To elucidate the causes and consequences of a system or network, models are meticulously constructed. These models serve as abstract representations of observable principles, capturing the essence of the systems they depict. It is important to note that these models are not meant to replace careful empirical observations. Instead, they are powerful tools designed to test and refine hypotheses about the dynamic properties of a system and the underlying mechanisms that drive observed phenomena. This dual approach ensures that theoretical insights are grounded in empirical reality, enhancing the robustness of the conclusions drawn.

Through the systematic and rigorous methodologies employed at SComB, the theoretical properties of complex systems and networks become more comprehensible. Modeling these properties not only aids in the understanding of current observations but also in predicting future behaviors and outcomes. This integrative approach makes the exploration and interpretation of complex systems more plausible and actionable, ultimately contributing to advancements in fields such as biology, medicine, and agriculture.
