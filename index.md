[SComB](https://dlsu-scomb.github.io/) is a research unit of the [Center for Natural Sciences and Environmental Research](https://www.dlsu.edu.ph/research/research-centers/censer/?fbclid=IwAR2_ZT71u1OxhE9xfvIapV30DncFlfFUkhDu-uuX2Et4S7VO6peHvcDnyU8) that integrates computational, mathematical and statistical modeling approaches to better understand the complexity of biological, medical and agricultural systems. To elucidate the causes and consequences of a system/network, models are built. Models provide an abstract representation of observable principles. These models are not a substitute for careful empirical observations, but instead are tools to assess hypotheses about the dynamic properties of a system and the mechanisms underlying the observations. Through the systematic approach that we will use, modeling the theoretical properties of a complex system/network is made more plausible.
